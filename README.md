# picture_slider
A simple picture slider using CSS animation and a little DOM with javascript.

I tried to keep simple and use minimum resourses. Just a basic DOM and also basic CSS animation.
I think it does what it is mean to do, so it's probably useful.

I would appreciate a lot tips about cleaning the code and maybe doing the same but with any simpler way.

Thanks for reading. Cheers.
